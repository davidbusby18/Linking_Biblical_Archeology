I'm using the large pipeline because I want my model to be able to predict the nominal subjects and direct objects as accurately as possible. The large pipeline has been trained on significantly more data and should do a better job with this task. Next, I define four variables called verses_ns, count_ns, verses_do and count_do, and I set each of these variables to 0. Then I begin iterating through the Biblical text. \n",

    "\n",
    "Next, I'm using a TRY block to handle any errors that may occur. Within this TRY block I will define doc by applying our nlp object to the each verse's text. Then, I will use a nested FOR loop to iterate through each token. Within this nested FOR loop, I will use a conditional statement to determine if a token is either \"God\" or \"Yahweh\". If so, I will use additional conditional statements to determine is that token is either a nominal subject or direct object. If so, I will increase the temporary count for each, respectively.\n",

In other words, He was actively engaging with his people in 11% of the Biblical record while his people were actively engaging with Him in only 2% of the record. "
