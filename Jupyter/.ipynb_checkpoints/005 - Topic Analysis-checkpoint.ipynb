I will then process the chapter data and add the tokenized and clean list of words from each to a corpus. I will then apply various topic modeling algorithms to this corpus and analyze the results for the best fit. Once that's done, I will determine which chapters belong to the various topics. "

I will then define an empty corpus list that we will use for topic modeling. There's some stuff about timing. Then, within a FOR loop I will iterate through the text for each chapter. First, I'll define an empty list called temp. Then, I will create a TRY block to handle any exceptions. Within this TRY block, I will create a document for each chapter by applying our nlp object to the chapter text. Then, I will created a nested FOR loop and iterate through each word of each chapter. Within this nested FOR loop, I first filter out any proper nouns. I've thought about this and decided I didn't want the topics to be driven by the people and places mentioned in each chapter. By removing proper nouns, I hope these topics will be more content driven. Next, I will use conditional statements to remove any word whose lemmatized version is in our customized list of stop words. For instance, \"say\" is in our list of stop words, so \"said\" would also be removed. I also removed punctuation. Then each lemmatized token is added to the list of words for that chapter. Once every token in a chapter has been iterated through, the entire list of lammetized words is added to our corpus list. Finally, an EXCEPT block is included to handle any errors and tell us where those errors occur so we can investigate."

    "Amazing! There are 48 chapters in this cluster and all but one come from Psalms. What fascinates me about this cluster is that these chapters all contain songs of worship. In fact, we still sing several worships songs that find their root in this list. Perhaps more fascinating, Psalm 22 is also in this list. This particular Psalm prophesies the death of Jesus in excruciating detail. To find this chapter in a cluster solely composed of worship songs is quite amazing!"

    "Many of the clusters have clearly defined themes and the chapters specific to books of the Bible often cluster together. All of the Gospels and Acts formed a cluster and the Epistles formed another. We have a cluster about genealogies and another about laws and regulations. There's even clusters about wisdom and songs of worships. Although not every cluster is so clearly themed, I am very happy with the outcome of this process."
