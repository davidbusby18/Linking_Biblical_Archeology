    "Even though I was well into my thirties and was raised in a Christian home, I'd never read the entire Bible from cover to cover. There were times I tried, but I always sputter out around Exodus or Leviticus. I just couldn't get passed all the \"sons of.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "But that was about to change. There was this guy at work, John, who was was so excited about reading the Bible that every day he would walk through the door and say something like, \"I just read Judges. It was amazing!\" At first I smiled and nodded, said something nice like, \"That's great,\" and moved on with the day. However, as time went by, John continued to share his progress and excitement, and my desire to read the Bible grew. One day I took the plunge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I'm in my forties and I've read or listening to the entire Bible every year since except one.  It is the most exciting book I've ever read, and I would love to inspire others to take the same plunge. To do this, I'm going to start with some basic analytics and then dig deeper into everything I can think of. Hopefully something I share will spark the same desire in others.\n",

As such, I won't load anything bigger than this. \n",

Within the FOR loop, I'm defining \"doc\" by applying our nlp object to each row of text data. Then, I'm creating a variable called \"count\" and setting it's initial value to zero. For each row, count will reset to zero before the text data is processed. Once this is done, I'm creating a nested FOR loop which will iterate through every token in our doc object. I'm not interested in punctuation, so I use an IF statement to tell the code to ignore punctuation tokens. Then I increase the count variable by 1 for each non-punctuation token. This continues until all non-punctuation tokens have been accounted for. Once this happens, the nested FOR loop will end and the final count for that row of data will be appended to our predefined list, word_count. This continues until all of rows of data have been analyzed. The last thing I'll do before analyzing this data is insert all of the word counts into our dataframe.\n",

However, before jumping straight into the calculations, we should acknowledge a couple other factors that may interfere:\n",
    "1. My reader starts each book and chapter with a short intro. This may not seem like much, but remember there are 66 books in the Bible and 1,189 chapters. This adds up. \n",
    "2. Sometimes, I want to listen to a passage again for clarification or because I've never thought about before.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't do anything about the second factor, but we can adjust for the first. My reader says around ten words to introduce each book and something like, \"Genesis chapter one\" before reading each chapter. That's ten additional words for each book and three additional words per chapter. "
